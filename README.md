## Installation
Note you will need Node 14

#### Option 1
Clone the repo, then inside that folder install the dependabot-pr commands globally with
`npm install -g .`

#### Option 2
`npm install -g git@github.com:blake-education/dependabot-prs.git`


#### Get Github permissions
Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and make a new personal access token

Give it these permissions
 - read:org 
 - read:repo_hook
 - repo

#### Set up environment variables
e.g. in your  `.zshenv`
 ```
export DEPENDABOT_PRS_GITHUB_TOKEN=(the personal access token you got above)
export DEPENDABOT_PRS_REPOS=mathseeds-prime-client fast-phonics-client #etc
```

### Commands

`dependabot-prs list`

The coloured dot reflects the state of CI

The emojis:
```
â†º - can't merge because the branch isn't up to date with develop
âœ‹ - waiting for a review to be mergeable
ðŸ§¹ - merge commit cannot be cleanly created. i.e. merge conflict
âœ” - mergeable - already been approved by someone
```

`dependabot-prs approve <repo-name> <pr-number>`

This will make a comment under your github name telling dependabot to merge that PR


### Auto completion:

Paste this in your .zshrc (or whatever) to get autocompletion of 
 - commands
 - repo names
 - list of open PRs 

```
